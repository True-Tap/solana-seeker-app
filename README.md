**True Tap** is the ultimate Solana-native payment app, engineered exclusively for the Solana Seeker device. We're unleashing lightning-fast, near-zero-fee transactions with taps so smooth, they feel like magic. Think Venmo meets Cash App meets AliPayâ€”powered by Solana's speed and Seeker's hardware security. Eventually, we'll evolve into the Stripe of Solana, empowering devs with seamless payment APIs.

Transform your Seeker into a decentralized finance beast: Send SOL with emoji flair, split bills in groups, stash in high-yield DeFi vaults, trade NFTs on the fly, set up merchant subscriptions in AI-driven marketplaces, scan QR codes for instant in-person buys (biometrics + Seed Vault locked), and surprise friends with virtual holiday envelopes. True Tap isn't just an appâ€”it's your gateway to intuitive, secure, revolutionary mobile money where every tap unlocks borderless commerce on Solana.

## Why True Tap? ðŸš€

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Narwhal Feature Drop 2025.1+)
- Solana Seeker or emulator (API 34+ ARM64)
- Git installed

### Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repo (private access required):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/True-Tap/solana-seeker-app.git
   cd solana-seeker-app
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio, sync Gradle.
3. Build & run on your Seeker.

If initializing from scratch:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: True Tap foundation"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/True-Tap/solana-seeker-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Usage
- Launch & connect wallet via Seed Vault (biometric auth).
- Tap to pay, send SOL, or dive into DeFiâ€”seamless from day one.
- Devs: Hook into our backend for custom integrations (docs incoming).

## Architecture Highlights
- **WalletRepository**: Core logic for MWA connection & session mgmt (`connectAndAuthWallet()` returns `Result<WalletAccount>`).
- **SeedVaultService**: Biometric signing, account derivation, emulator fallback.
- **WalletViewModel**: Flows for status, auth resultsâ€”ready for UI hookup.
- Models: `WalletAccount`, `AuthState`, `WalletResult<T>` for clean data handling.

Security: Hardware-enforced, no seed exposure, auto-session restore.
